# Webapps For Beginners

*Ruby Monday Study Group curriculum for intermediates*

This book has been written after we have run 4 beginners groups at our [Ruby
Monstas](http://rubymonstas.org) groups in Berlin, which then turn into
intermediate groups. It outlines the current state of our intermediate groups
curriculum.
