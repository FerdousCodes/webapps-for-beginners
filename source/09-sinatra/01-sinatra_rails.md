# Sinatra versus Rails

Maybe you could compare Sinatra to a bicycle, and Rails to a car. Both do
the job of helping you to get from A to B.

Sinatra is much more lightweight, needs less resources, and does fewer things
out of the box. Rails on the other hand is packed with features, comes with a
ton of code, and makes it very easy to build complicated web applications in
limited time, if you know how to use it. Of course, because it's lightweight,
Sinatra also is much faster than Rails, and this is where our little metaphor
ended fairly quickly :) Rack, by the way, would be a pair of shoes. Sinatra and
Rails both use Rack under the hood.

So which one is better for a beginner?

Both are great :) Sinatra is great for learning the basics of HTTP and routing.
Rails on the other hand is better for learning how to use a database, and
actually store things, learn the concept of a "resource" etc.
