# SQLite

SQLite is a minimalistic implementation of a relational database that supports
most of SQL, although not all of it. It is less powerful than, for example,
PostgreSQL and MySQL, but it's also super lightweight, and great for learning,
experiments, and getting started quickly.

We are going to use the database SQLite in our examples, so you may want to
make sure you have it installed.

Check if it's installed by running this in your terminal:

```
$ sqlite3 --version
```

If that outputs a version then SQLite is installed. If it's not, Mislav has
written up nice instructions [over here](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/rails/install-sqlite3/).
