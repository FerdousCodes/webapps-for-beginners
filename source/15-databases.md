# Databases

Databases are applications that help us store data in a flexible, and powerful
way, and they have been around ever since the 1960s. Nowadays there are lots
of different types of databases.

For now we'll focus on the most prevalent, traditional type of databases, which
are called "relational databases" (or [RDBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)).
