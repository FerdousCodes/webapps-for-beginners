# Sinatra

<a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a quite popular, small
framework for writing web applications. It sits somewhere between Rack and
Rails in terms of how many features it provides, and what kind of things it
makes easy for developers, and what kind of things one has to implement on
their own.

We'll use Sinatra for introducing quite a few concepts that are common to
all web applications, before we then, later move on to learning how to
build a Rails appplication.
